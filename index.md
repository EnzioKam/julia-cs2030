# Julia for CS2030

This site is a for-fun attempt at a partial reproduction of some content from the NUS module
[CS2030 / CS2030S](https://nus-cs2030-2021-s3.github.io/notes/). Currently still a work-in-progress.

Note that Julia is a very different language from the original language used, Java, from the paradigm
(multiple dispatch) to the availability of different functions and utilities in the standard library.
Several things that can be done easily in Java, are difficult or near impossible to do in Julia. Some
advantages of Julia will also be highligted.

Please do not use this as a reference, as I cannot guarrantee that there will be no mistakes.
